# health-care-analysis
A project on how many days a patient will stay in the hospital according to the symptoms of the patients.

PRCP-1022-HospitalStayPred

Problem Statement

Task 1:- Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:- Create a machine learning model to predict the length of stay (in days) of a patient entering the Hospital, given various factors about their stay.

Dataset Description and Link:
The dataset consists of codes for the hospital type, city and region. Further included are features like ward, ward type, department, extra rooms in hospital, bed grade, type of admission, severity of illness, accompanying visitors, age of patient, admission deposit etc.

Domain: Healthcare
Model Comparison Report

Create a report stating the performance of multiple models on this data and suggest the best model for production.

Report on Challenges faced

Create a report which should include challenges you faced on data and what technique was used with proper reasoning.

Note:- All above tasks must be created on a single jupyter notebook and  the same should be shared as part of final submission of the project.





We have analyzed four models, namely Random forest model, Gradient Boosting Model, Stacked model and Decision tree model. Now we found that Stacked Generalization model has highest accuracy of 41%.
Case I â€“ Find length of the stay if hospital type code
